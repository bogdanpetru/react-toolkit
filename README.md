# React Toolkit

> Professionally Built React Components - Made the React Way

## Purpose

The purpose of the `React Toolkit (@zippytech/react-toolkit)` is to provide a set of high-quality open-source UI components built with React that can be easily composed to build professional-grade apps.

## Installation

**Zippy React Toolkit** is distributed via **npm** - more exactly, via a **custom npm registry** (https://registry.zippytech.io). Getting it installed requires an additional step: you have to point the npm CLI to the correct registry for packages in the `@zippytech` scope:

```sh
$ npm config set @zippytech:registry https://registry.zippytech.io
```

After this, you can install install it with

```sh
$ npm install @zippytech/react-toolkit --save
```
