# Examples

## Example 1: Fancy handle with arrows

Let's costumise the handle completely. Add icons in the render icon and style it a bit.

All styling is applied via a new class added by `classNames` on the slider and then targeting the children of the slide like the track bar, track fill and handler.

## Example 2: Fixed prices slider

Popular use case where a search filter needs to limit results based on a certain price
range and we have increments of thousands.

## Example 3: Month of the year picker

Even though the slide works with numbers, there's nothing stopping us from using a custom labels and picking string values from a set of predefined number -> string mappings.
